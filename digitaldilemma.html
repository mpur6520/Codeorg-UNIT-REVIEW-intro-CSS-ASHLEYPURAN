   </td>
  <td>I'd argue that this is for the better, on some circumstances--if the athlete is able to sign an agreement with the tattoo artist saying that it's alright, then I feel like it's for the better. I also think it depends on how clear the tattoo is, because if it's barely legible then I don't think it's as big of a problem--Also, I think adding the fact that it's the athlete showcasing the tattoo and having it as a part of their identity makes the situation a bit tentative</td>

  <tr>
   <td>People have begun to digitalize DNA as well as promote online DNA testing. They store DNA in an online database, which can be detrimental to biosecurity.</td>

        <li>Online DNA tests can be easily hacked into, posing a security risk.</li>
        <li>It can be used to create biological weapons.</li>

   <td>I'd argue that this is for the worse. The harmful factors outweigh the positive, and as described in the article, this sort of stuff carries massive security issues. Especially in the case of online DNA testing services, the risk isn't worth it--you can go to a more secure place in real life, where there's less risk of confidential information being spilled out for people to see. </td>

        <li>To some people, it's unnerving to see a dead person as if they were alive.</li>
        <li>Some may not want their acting career to feature something they essentially had nothing to do with.</li>
        <li>Actors are unable to give their consent for this to happen.</li>

    <p>BENEFIT</p>
      <ul style="list-style: circle;">
        <li>Films are able to bring back characters that their audience likes.</li>
        <li>It can be used to honor someone's legacy, who worked hard on something such as a movie but was unable to finish.</li>
      </ul>
   </td>
   <td>I'd argue that this is for the worst, but could be better--if there was a system, such as a contract, that allows actors to consent for this before they're dead, then it would be more for the better. Ethical wise I'd say it's for the worse, but production wise I'd say it's for the better. This entirely depends on whether or not you care about ethics in the first place too, because it's a topic that can be different for everyone; I'd say the situation is tentative.</td>

<h2>Lesson 12: Project Digital Information Dilemmas | Part 1</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to read and understand how digitalization can benefit and harm certain groups.</p>
<h5>Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs?</h5>
<h6>I think it would beat the purpose of going to a museum because everything would technically be online now--Though, as a benefit, it would make information more accessible for people who either can't afford to go to a museum or would rather not.</h6>

<h2>Lesson 13: Project Digital Information Dilemmas | Part 2</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to understand digitalization and the types of impact it has.</p>
<h5>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</h5>
<h6>We should care about information being represented digitally because it's something we see daily in our lives, but don't stop twice to think about. Meanwhile, these things can be impacting certain groups while we don't notice; this doesn't essentially impact me personally, though. I see digitalization sometimes, though it's probably more than I notice--and, it might just be me, but there are some scenarios that seem petty, that could be fixed by just giving credit and funds rather than starting a huge debate over it. Though personally, I don't think I'd mind it if art or music of mines was digitalized--however, I'd prefer it if I were credited.</h6>
