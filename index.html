<h2>Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to introduce us to computer science principles by familiarizing us with innovations and ideas.</p>
<h5>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h5>
<h6>My strategies to learn best include getting a good night of sleep, taking notes, and doing my best to pay attention. These are similar to Sam and Jasmine because Jasmine attempts to get a good rest to pay attention, and Sam attempts to take notes. It's different from Sofia's because my strategies don't include taking breaks whenever needed, but also different from Sam's. After all, with my strategy, it doesn't matter whether you take notes physically or not.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 2: Representing Information</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to familiarize us with how messages are sent and the different ways that information could be represented.</p>
<h5>Recall when you built your information-sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</h5>
<h6>We actually did change our devices to represent more options, but it was a little more complicated than creating a device that only communicated two options. It's simpler than making a system for multiple options.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to familiarize us with patterns and help us identify set rulesets for that pattern; it eased us into creating our own patterns and rules too.</p>
<h5>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h5>
<h6>I would express that it's essentially symbols that indicate a numeric value; if they don't know what a numeric value is, I'd say that a number system is something that allows things to be counted/taken into account through symbols that represent amounts.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to familiarize us with binary and how base systems work; it teaches us how binary can represent decimal numbers.</p>
<h5>How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?</h5>
<h6>I don't know exactly how many students there were in class today, however, for a class of around 30, you would need 5 bits.</h6>
<h5>Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</h5>
<h6>The amount of numbers we can make increases every time we add another bit.</h6>
<h5>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h5>
<h6>The binary system only uses two symbols, 1 and 0, while the decimal system uses symbols from 0 to 9. The binary system can only create certain decimals while the decimal system is able to create all of them. Some similarities include that they're able to represent the same numbers, just in different ways.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 5: Overflowing & Rounding</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to help us understand more about bits and what exactly they can and can't do.</p>
<h5>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?</h5>
<h6>When a car drives beyond its maximum reading, the odometer resets back to 0.</h6>
<h5>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h5>
<h6>If using binary to represent fractions of a number, you can't create all possible fractions. This is because binary is base 2, meaning that it relies on exponents; while you can have negative exponents to give you values such as 0.25, there's no way for people to create values such as 0.17 only with binary.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 6: Representing Text</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to familiarize ourselves with how systems can represent text, and the multiple ways that it can be represented in general.</p>
<h5>"The binary pattern 01000001 represents the number 65." Write a brief response explaining whether you believe this statement is always true. Explain your reasoning.</h5>
<h6>I think that this is true to an extent in regard to binary. This is because while there could be different ways to represent different numbers as that, in regards to binary itself, with that string alone it would represent the number 65. So yes, I think it's true, but only in regard to this specific situation.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 7: Black and White Images</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to learn more about how you can represent pixels with things such as binary and hexadecimal, and use them to create black-and-white photos.</p>
<h5>Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</h5>
<h6>The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.<br><br> The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.</h6>
<h5>Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black-and-white image?</h5>
<h6>Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken.</h6>
<h5>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</h5>
<h6>I would attempt to use as many samples as possible to provide a good digital approximation; I would use relatively small samples in order to increase the number of smaller squares, and therefore the digital representation would hopefully look closer to the original.</h6>

<br>

<h2>Lesson 8: Color Images</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to learn about how computers represent colored photos, and how you can represent them using binary and bits.</p>
<h5>Which statement about analog and digital images is true?</h5>
<h6>Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.</h6>
<h5>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h5>
<h6>Higher sampling allows for better representation of the image, in which RBG pixels are able to replicate the exact colors of it; binary is used to make this possible, telling how much red, green, and blue to use.</h6>

<br>
  
<h2>Lesson 9: Lossless Compression</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to learn about lossless compression, a way where a computer can shrink down data without losing any of it.</p>
<h5>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</h5>
<h6>The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be reconstructed back to the original.</h6>
<h5>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email address.
<br><br>
If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</h5>
<h6>I would say that there isn't a part of their book being deleted, but rather that the file was compressed. I'd explain that they most likely have repeated words such as "I" or another vocabulary that, within code, can be categorized as data being grouped together--these words aren't lost and the action can be undone, but it's just done for the file size to be smaller.</h6>

<br>
  
<h2>Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to learn about lossy compression, a way where a computer can shrink down data but lose some in the process; we learned about scenarios where this is a good method.</p>
<h5>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2-gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, videos, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h5>
<h6>I think the categories that are best compressed using lossless compression include text messages and music, while the best for lossy compression would be videos and images. This is because I think that you wouldn't be able to notice a loss of data with videos or images as much as you would with text messages or music--I think the music would become choppy, and the text messages would be harder to read or understand.</h6>

<br>
  
<h2>Lesson 11: Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The point of this lesson was to learn about copyright, how to avoid it, how it works, why it exists, and different types of copyright such as Creative Commons.</p>
<h5>How is a Creative Commons license different from regular copyright?</h5>
<h6>It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</h6>
<h5>As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:
<br><br>
Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.
<br><br>
Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</h5>
<h6>In this scenario, the person who created the T-shirt should credit me and give me a sum of the money that they receive for selling the T-shirt. They should also reach out to me for permission first, asking if it's alright with me.</h6>
